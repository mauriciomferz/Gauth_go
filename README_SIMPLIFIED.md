# GAuth Go Simplified - Development Prototype

**🏗️ Development Prototype** | ✅ **Health Endpoints Working** | 📚 **Educational Reference** | ⚠️ **Development Framework**

A simplified, educational implementation of RFC-0111 and RFC-0115 authorization frameworks in Go.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains a **development prototype** and **educational reference** for:
- RFC-0111 (GAuth 1.0) authorization framework concepts
- RFC-0115 (Power-of-Attorney Definition) implementation patterns
- Professional Go project structure and development practices
- Kubernetes deployment patterns for authorization services

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This is NOT production-ready software.** While it demonstrates professional development practices, the core authorization logic is simplified for educational purposes. Real cryptographic implementations, production security mechanisms, and comprehensive testing would be required for actual use.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+ 
- Docker (optional)
- Kubernetes cluster (optional)

### 1. Run Demo Application
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/mauriciomferz/Gauth_go_simplified.git
cd Gauth_go_simplified

# Run demo server
cd cmd/demo
go run main.go
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoints
```bash
# Test the working health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/ready
```

### 3. Run Security Tests
```bash
cd cmd/security-test
go run main.go
```

## 🔧 What Works

### ✅ Functional Components
- **Go Package Structure**: 28 properly organized packages
- **Health Endpoints**: Working `/health` and `/ready` for Kubernetes
- **Demo Applications**: Multiple working examples
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API references
- **Docker Support**: Container builds and runs successfully
- **Kubernetes Ready**: Deployable manifests with proper health checks
- **Testing Framework**: Test suites for core components

### ✅ Professional Practices Demonstrated
- Clean Go project organization
- Proper error handling patterns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Container orchestration setup
- Monitoring and observability patterns
- CI/CD pipeline structure
