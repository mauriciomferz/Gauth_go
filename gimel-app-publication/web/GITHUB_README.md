## 📋 What's Inside

This repository contains comprehensive web-based demonstrations of the GAuth Protocol, showcasing its revolutionary approach to authorization and governance.

### 🌟 **Standalone Demonstrations** (No Server Required)

#### 1. **RFC111 Benefits Showcase** 
📄 [`rfc111-benefits-showcase.html`](rfc111-benefits-showcase.html)

**Demonstrates:** Core benefits of GAuth protocol over traditional authorization systems
- **Performance**: 99.2% faster processing (4-8 hours → 30 seconds)
- **Accuracy**: AI-powered improvement (85% → 96% accuracy)  
- **Transparency**: Complete audit trails with cryptographic verification
- **Scenarios**: AI governance, healthcare compliance, supply chain transparency

#### 2. **RFC111+RFC115 Paradigm Shift Showcase**
📄 [`rfc111-rfc115-paradigm-showcase.html`](rfc111-rfc115-paradigm-showcase.html)

**Demonstrates:** Revolutionary transformation from Policy-based Permission to Power-of-Attorney Protocol
- **Business Ownership**: Transform from IT-controlled to business-owned authorization
- **Legal Framework**: Real-world power-of-attorney relationships with legal enforceability
- **Enterprise Scaling**: 1M+ concurrent users with 99.99% uptime
- **Compliance**: Multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA)

### 🖥️ **Server-Based Applications** (Advanced Features)

#### Backend Servers with Full API Support
- **RFC111 Benefits Server** (Port 8081): 13 API endpoints
- **RFC111+RFC115 Paradigm Server** (Port 8082): 12 API endpoints

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Instant Demo (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gimel-Foundation/GiFo-RFC-0150-Go-Implementation-of-GAuth-1.0.git
cd GiFo-RFC-0150-Go-Implementation-of-GAuth-1.0/web

```

### Option 2: Server-Based Applications

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.19+

```bash
# Install dependencies for RFC111 Benefits server
cd rfc111-benefits/backend
go mod init gauth-rfc111-benefits
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin github.com/gin-contrib/cors

# Start RFC111 Benefits Server (Port 8081)
go run main.go
```

```bash
# Install dependencies for Paradigm Shift server  
cd rfc111-rfc115-paradigm/backend
go mod init gauth-rfc111-rfc115-paradigm
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin github.com/gin-contrib/cors

# Start RFC111+RFC115 Paradigm Server (Port 8082)
go run main.go
```
