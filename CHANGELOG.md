## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-02 ‚ö†Ô∏è EMERGENCY CLEANUP RELEASE
### CRITICAL - Emergency Security Cleanup
- **üö® REMOVED DANGEROUS LEGAL CLAIMS** - Eliminated false GDPR compliance implementations
- **ÔøΩÔ∏è REMOVED AMATEUR CRYPTOGRAPHY** - Eliminated SHA256 usage in security-critical code  
- **‚ùå REMOVED FALSE SECURITY CLAIMS** - Corrected "zero vulnerabilities" and development status documentation
- **‚öñÔ∏è ELIMINATED LEGAL LIABILITY** - Removed unvalidated legal compliance frameworks
- **üìã COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION UPDATE** - All docs updated to reflect development prototype reality

### Removed (Dangerous Code)
- **‚ùå pkg/auth/gdpr_compliance.go** - False GDPR compliance with amateur crypto
- **‚ùå pkg/auth/legal_framework_*.go** - Unvalidated legal implementations
- **‚ùå pkg/auth/tamper_proof_audit.go** - Amateur crypto with false security claims
