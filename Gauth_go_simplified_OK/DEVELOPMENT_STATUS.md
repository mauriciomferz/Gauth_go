# Development Status: Educational Implementation Only

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE ⚠️

This implementation of GAuth in Go is:

1. **Educational Tool Only**
   - For learning Go development patterns
   - For understanding RFC structures
   - For prototyping authorization concepts
   - NOT for production use

2. **Security Status**
   - No real security implementation
   - No cryptographic validation
   - No persistent storage
   - No production-grade features
   - In-memory only, data lost on restart

3. **Intended Use**
   - ✅ Learning & Development
   - ✅ Educational Demonstrations
   - ✅ Understanding Authorization Concepts
   - ❌ NOT for Production
   

4. **For Production Needs**
   Use established solutions:
   - Auth0
   - Keycloak
   - AWS Cognito
   - Azure AD B2C

## Limitations Are By Design

This implementation deliberately keeps things simple for educational purposes. It lacks:
- Real cryptography
- Persistent storage
- User management
- Password hashing
- Multi-factor authentication
- Distributed capabilities
- Production monitoring
- Security hardening

## Recommended Use

1. Use as a learning tool
2. Study the code patterns
3. Understand the RFC structure
4. Practice Go development
5. DO NOT deploy in production
