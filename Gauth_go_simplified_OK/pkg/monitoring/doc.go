Package monitoring provides comprehensive observability tools for security and performance monitoring.

This package implements advanced monitoring capabilities including metrics
collection, tracing, and logging for security-related operations. It's designed
to work seamlessly with the event system and provides real-time insights into
authentication and authorization processes.

Key Features:

1. Metrics Collection:
  - Request rates and throughput
  - Error rates and categories
  - Latency tracking and percentiles
  - Resource usage and capacity planning

2. Distributed Tracing:
  - End-to-end request tracing
  - Error tracking with correlation IDs
  - Dependency monitoring with service mesh integration
  - Performance bottleneck analysis

3. Security Monitoring:
  - Authentication attempts and success rates
  - Authorization decisions with policy context
  - Token operations and lifecycle events
  - Policy changes with audit trail
  - Anomaly detection for security events

4. Integration:
  - Prometheus and Grafana support
  - OpenTelemetry compatibility
  - Log aggregation with structured formats
  - Alerting and notification systems

Basic Usage:

	// Create a monitoring instance with default configuration
	monitor := monitoring.New()

	// Track authentication request
	monitor.TrackAuthRequest(ctx, user, result)

	// Create a trace span for an operation
	span := monitor.StartSpan(ctx, "token_validation")
	defer span.End()
