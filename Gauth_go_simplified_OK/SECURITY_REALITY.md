# Security Reality Check

## ⚠️ NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE ⚠️

This implementation has NO real security:

1. **Authentication**
   - No real user authentication
   - No password hashing
   - No MFA
   - Anyone can impersonate anyone

2. **Token Management**
   - In-memory only
   - No persistent storage
   - Lost on restart
   - No real cryptographic validation

3. **JWT Implementation**
   - Mock implementation only
   - No real signature validation
   - No key management
   - No certificate validation
   - No proper revocation

4. **Storage**
   - Everything in-memory
   - No persistence
   - No backup/restore
   - No replication
   - No disaster recovery

5. **Cryptography**
   - No real cryptographic operations
   - No proper key management
   - No secure random numbers
   - No side-channel protection

6. **Production Features Missing**
   - No monitoring
   - No alerting
   - No audit trail
   - No compliance features
   - No scalability
   - No high availability

## Educational Value Only

This implementation is EXCELLENT for:
- Learning Go patterns
- Understanding RFC structures
- Educational demonstrations
- Development prototypes

## DO NOT USE FOR:
- Production systems
- Real authentication
- Real security
- Enterprise applications
- Compliance requirements

## For Real Security Needs:
Use established solutions like:
- Auth0
- Keycloak
- AWS Cognito
- Azure AD B2C
