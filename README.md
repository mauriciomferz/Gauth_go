# GiFo-RFC-0150: Go Implementation of GAuth 1.0

**Official Go Implementation of the GAuth Authorization Framework**

This repository contains the official Go implementation of:
- **GiFo-RFC-0111**: GAuth 1.0 Authorization Framework 
- **GiFo-RFC-0115**: Power-of-Attorney Credential Definition

## 🎯 Purpose

This implementation provides:
- **RFC-Compliant Framework**: Full implementation of GiFo-RFC-0111 and GiFo-RFC-0115
- **Professional Go Architecture**: 24 packages with proper structure and organization
- **Educational Reference**: Demonstrates authorization system design patterns
- **Security Patterns**: Shows proper implementation approaches (though not production-ready)

## 🚨 BRUTAL HONESTY SECTION

**WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS:**
- ✅ **Excellent architecture documentation** showing how authorization systems should be designed
- ✅ **Professional Go project structure** with good interface design
- ✅ **Educational reference** for understanding RFC compliance requirements
- ❌ **Zero functional security** - all cryptography is stubbed out
- ❌ **Mock implementations everywhere** - returns hardcoded "success" responses
- ❌ **No real authentication** - anyone can impersonate anyone
- ❌ **No real authorization** - only checks if fields aren't empty
- ❌ **Compilation conflicts** - multiple incompatible implementations stacked together

**ESTIMATED COST TO MAKE THIS REAL:** $2-5 million, 18-24 months, team of security experts

**🚨 CRITICAL EXAMPLE**: Token revocation just prints "revoked" but tokens remain valid! Any "revoked" token becomes valid again after server restart. See [CRITICAL_SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md](CRITICAL_SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed breakdown of this dangerous security theater.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+ 
- Docker (optional)
- Kubernetes cluster (optional)

### 1. Run Demo Application
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/mauriciomferz/Gauth_go_simplified.git
cd Gauth_go_simplified

# Run demo server
cd cmd/demo
go run main.go
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoints
```bash
# Test the working health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/ready
```

### 3. Run Security Tests
```bash
cd cmd/security-test
go run main.go
```

## 🔧 What Works

### ✅ Functional Components
- **Go Package Structure**: 28 properly organized packages
