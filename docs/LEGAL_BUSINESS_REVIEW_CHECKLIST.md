**üî¥ HIGH RISK AREAS:**
```go
// Example areas that need legal review:
type PowerOfAttorney struct {
    Principal     string    // Legal entity validation needed
    Agent         string    // Authority verification needed  
    Powers        []string  // Scope limitations per jurisdiction
    Jurisdiction  string    // Legal framework compliance
    ValidUntil    time.Time // Regulatory expiry requirements
}
```

## 2. Business Logic Validation

### ‚úÖ Items to Review with Business Experts:

func (s *AuthzService) CheckCompliance(req AuthRequest) error {
    // This logic MUST be reviewed by compliance experts
    if req.ResourceType == "FinancialData" && !s.hasSOXCompliance(req.Principal) {
        return errors.New("SOX compliance required")
    }
    // More compliance checks...
}

        DataRetention: "6 years",           // VERIFY: Correct for all data types?
        ConsentRequired: true,              // VERIFY: All consent scenarios covered?
        RightToErasure: true,              // VERIFY: Implementation complete?
    },
    "CCPA": {
        DataSaleOptOut: true,              // VERIFY: Proper opt-out mechanism?
        ConsumerRights: []string{"access", "delete", "portability"}, // VERIFY: Complete list?
