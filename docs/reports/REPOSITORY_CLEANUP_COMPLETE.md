- **Documentation Organization**: Created clear hierarchy with `/docs/` categorization
- **Archive Management**: Preserved historical files in `/archive/` for reference
- **Build System**: Maintained functional Makefile and Go build process

### Key Moves
- Development guides → `docs/development/`
- Technical specifications → `docs/`
- Historical records → `archive/`
- Examples organization maintained

## Phase 2: Advanced Organization (Commit: b6a6c59)
### Achievements
- **Docker Consolidation**: Streamlined from 4 Dockerfiles to 1 main + 3 archived
- **Demo App Structure**: Organized gauth-demo-app with proper subdirectories
- **System Cleanup**: Removed all temporary and build artifacts
- **Professional Layout**: Achieved enterprise-standard project organization

### Key Changes
- **Files Reorganized**: 21 files affected with logical categorization
- **Temporary Cleanup**: Removed 6 log/temp files (*.log, *.tmp, .DS_Store)
- **Docker Strategy**: Main Dockerfile in root for GitHub Actions compatibility
- **Documentation Structure**: Created docs/ and scripts/ subdirectories in demo app

## Final Repository Structure
