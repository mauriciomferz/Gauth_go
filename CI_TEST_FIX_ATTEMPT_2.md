# CI Test Failure Fix - Attempt 2

## Problem Analysis

**Issue**: Tests pass locally with exit code 0 but fail in CI with exit code 1.

**Local Environment**:
- Go version: 1.25.1 darwin/arm64
- Tests pass with some linker warnings (malformed LC_DYSYMTAB)
- Redis/PostgreSQL tests are properly skipped when services unavailable

**CI Environment**:
- Go version: 1.23 (version mismatch identified)
- Ubuntu latest runner
- Limited resources and different environment

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Go Version Mismatch**: Local uses Go 1.25.1, CI uses Go 1.23
2. **Missing External Services**: Redis and PostgreSQL not available in CI
3. **Environment Differences**: CI runners have different resource constraints
4. **Exit Code Handling**: CI might be sensitive to warnings or subprocess exit codes

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Go Version Matrix Testing
- Added Go 1.25 to test matrix alongside 1.23
- This ensures compatibility across versions

### 2. External Service Dependencies
- Added Redis service using `supercharge/redis-github-action@1.7.0`
- Added PostgreSQL service using `harmon758/postgresql-action@v1`
- This prevents skipped tests from potentially causing issues

### 3. Enhanced Test Execution
- Added explicit bash script for test execution
- Improved exit code handling with `set -euo pipefail`
- Added detailed logging and version information
- Explicit success/failure reporting

### 4. Environment Normalization
- Set `CGO_ENABLED=1` explicitly
- Set `GOMAXPROCS=2` and `GOMEMLIMIT=1GiB` for consistency
- Clean test cache before execution

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Go 1.23**: Should now pass with Redis/PostgreSQL services available
2. **Go 1.25**: Should pass consistently matching local environment
3. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging will help identify specific failure points
4. **Robust Exit Codes**: Explicit script handling should prevent false failures

## Test Coverage

The CI tests the following packages:
- `./pkg/...` - Core GAuth packages
- `./internal/...` - Internal implementation packages  
- `./examples/cascade/pkg/gauth` - Cascade example
- `./test/...` - Integration and benchmark tests

**Notable Exclusions**:
- `gauth-demo-app` websocket tests (potential timing issues)
- Development/deployment specific tests

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. Both Go version matrix results
2. Test execution time (should be under 15m timeout)
3. Specific package test results
4. Resource usage patterns

## Next Steps if This Fails

1. Run CI tests with even more verbose logging
2. Test individual package groups separately
3. Investigate specific test timing issues
4. Consider disabling race detection in CI
5. Add manual test result validation
