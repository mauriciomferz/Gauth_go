# Go Version and Linter Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

**Error**: `golangci-lint` failing with version compatibility issue:
```
Error: ../../../go/pkg/mod/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.41.0/blake2b/go125.go:7:9: 
file requires newer Go version go1.25 (application built with go1.24) (typecheck)
```

**Root Cause**: Version inconsistency across the project:
- `go.mod` specified `go 1.23.0`
- Dependency `golang.org/x/crypto v0.41.0` requires Go 1.25
- CI jobs using different Go versions (1.23, 1.24, 1.25)
- Local development using Go 1.25.1

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated go.mod
```diff
- go 1.23.0
+ go 1.25
```

### 2. Standardized CI Configuration
Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
- **Test matrix**: Changed from `['1.23', '1.25']` to `['1.25']` 
- **Build job**: Updated from `1.23` to `1.25`
- **Security scan job**: Updated from `1.23` to `1.25`
- **Linter**: Added timeout configuration for better reliability

### 3. Updated Documentation
- Updated README.md badge from "Go-1.23+" to "Go-1.25+"
- Ensures consistency between documentation and actual requirements

### 4. Verified Compatibility
- Ran `go mod tidy` to ensure module consistency
- Verified local build works with Go 1.25.1
- All dependencies are compatible with Go 1.25

## Expected Results

✅ **Linter should now pass** - All Go versions aligned at 1.25+
✅ **Tests should continue passing** - Already working locally with 1.25.1
✅ **Build should work** - Verified locally and updated CI
✅ **Security scan should work** - Now using consistent Go version

## Technical Details

**Dependency Chain**:
- `golang.org/x/crypto v0.41.0` → Requires Go 1.25
- Our project uses this crypto version for security features
- Rather than downgrade crypto (security risk), upgraded Go requirement

**CI Jobs Affected**:
1. **test**: Now uses Go 1.25 exclusively (removed matrix)
2. **build**: Updated from 1.23 → 1.25  
3. **security-scan**: Updated from 1.23 → 1.25
4. **linter**: Inherits Go 1.25 from test job, added timeout

## Compatibility Impact

**Breaking Change**: Minimum Go version increased from 1.23 → 1.25
- **Justification**: Required by security dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Go 1.25 is current stable release
- **Alternative**: Would require downgrading security libraries (not recommended)

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Local build successful with Go 1.25.1
2. ✅ `go mod tidy` runs cleanly
3. ✅ All CI configuration updated consistently
4. ⏳ CI pipeline will verify full compatibility

**Status**: Ready for CI validation
**Next**: Monitor CI pipeline to confirm linter passes
