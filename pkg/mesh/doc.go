Package mesh provides service mesh integration for GAuth authentication services.

This package provides components for integrating GAuth with service mesh technologies
like Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect. It enables:

  - Mutual TLS authentication
  - Service-to-service authentication
  - Distributed request tracing
  - Mesh-based authorization policies
  - Traffic management for authentication services
  - Circuit breaking for authentication dependencies
  - Canary deployments of auth services
  - Authentication service discovery

The mesh package ensures that GAuth can be properly integrated into modern
microservice architectures that utilize service mesh technologies for
communication, security, and observability.
